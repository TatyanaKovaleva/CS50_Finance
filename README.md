# CS50_Finance
Mock Stock Trading Site, Problem Set 7 for CS50X, uses Python and Flask

This was done as a problem set for Harvard's CS50.
See [this website](http://docs.cs50.net/problems/finance/finance.html) for a specification.

This was my first foray into Flask, while I was still very new with Python. As such, there's a lot of things that could be done better (i.e. docstrings instead of comment blocks, code tests, better use of templates, etc...).
The effort to clean it up wouldn't be very productive or educational though, so I'll leave it pretty much 'as-is'.
